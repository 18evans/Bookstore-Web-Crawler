#Web Crawler

This is the a group project of Testing and Continuos Integration (TCI) course from Fontys.

The aim of the project is to design, implement and test a Web Crawler [(Read more about Web Crawler here)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler) 
using the Test Driven Developement (TDD) process.

## Getting Started

Steps to import project:
1. Close all your IntelliJ projects so you're on the home window.
2. Select "Check out from Version Control"
3. Enter gitlab repository HTTPS and select a local folder to download the project in.
4. When prompted to open project select yes and when prompted for Gradle import check the "Auto-import" check-box.

For some users, if there is a current open project and "Create new Project from VCS (version control)" is selected, they will get some Java JDK errors on the import gradle part and project won't load on IntelliJ properly.


### Prerequisites

1. IntelliJ IDE (any version but the latest one is always recommended)
2. User should have experience in programming with Java
3. User should have experience with different unit test frameworks (JUnit, Mockito, Hamcrest)
4. Internet connection is required for the WebCrawler to work.
5. Internet + Cisco VPN connect to the fontys network is required in order to access the example hosted site used for crawling/scraping in this project (http://i367506.hera.fhict.nl/webcrawl_example/catalog.php)
