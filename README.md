# TCI_group_project

Steps to import project:
1. Close all your IntelliJ projects so you're on the home window.
2. Select "Check out from Version Control"
3. Enter gitlab repository HTTPS and select a local folder to download the project in.
4. When prompted to open project select yes and when prompted for Gradle import check the "Auto-import" check-box.

For me if I have a current open project and select "Create new Project from VCS (version control)" I'll get some Java JDK errors on the import gradle part and project won't load on IntelliJ properly.
